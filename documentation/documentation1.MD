//
In the atomic physics domain it is essential that we use quantum mechanics to understand things, but non relativistic quantum mechanics is mostly adequate. I.e. we don't need to include changes introduced by special relativity

//
Strictly speaeking this is not true when dealing with the quanta of the electromagnetic field, namely photons, but electromagnetic phenomena can be largely understood in terms of transitions between quantum states involving the emission or absorption of a photon

//
The most complete theory involving the electromagnetic interaction between electrons and photons is called quantum electrodynamics or QED. This is a relativistic field theory in which electron and positron particles can be created or destroyed in pairs along with the creation and destruction of photons.

//
In the nuclear domain, involving structure of various nuclides, decay of unstable nuclides, nuclear reactions allowing re-arrangement and formation of various nuclides, we can achieve adequate understanding with the following

(1) - NRQM: Non-relativistic quantum mechanics
(2) - Special relativity (SR) concepts to describe the high nuclear binding energies and energies available from significant mass changes, i.e. a directiona pplication of the energy equals mass multiplied by the speed of light squared concept.
(3) - Newtonian energy and momentum concepts to approximately describe the motion of the massive nuclides (p,n,d, 4he, etc)
(4) - SR energy and momentum concepts to describe the motion of lighter leptons (electrons, positronts, neutrinos, anti neutrinos and photons)
(5) - Description of the couloumb force between charged particles use a suitable potential (approximately 1/r) in NRQM
(6) - Description of the complex attractive strong nuclear force between nucleons (proton proton, neutron proton and neutron neutronj interactions) using an emerical short range potential. Note the nucleon nucleon force has some dependancy on (n,p) and spin but adequate to consider it independant of these properties
(7) - Description of these properties: Description of the weak nuclear reaction as a very hsort range (<~ 10^-17meters) reaction that describes beta decay processes in a largely phenomenological way

//
Beta decay processes involve decay of various nuclides with the emission of either an electron or positron along with an appropriate neutrino

three processes:
(1) - beta- decay - Neutron -> proton + electron + neutrino
(2) - beta+ decay - Proton -> neutron + positron + neutrino
(3) - electron capture - Proton + electron -> neutron + neutrino

All three processes are related by the particle physics crossing principle
beta-: neutron -> proton + electron + neutrino
       lithium8 -> bereliyum8 + electron + neutrino
       cobolt60 -> nickel60 + electron + neutrino

beta+: proton -> neutron + positron + neutrino
       flourine18 -> oxygen18 + positron + neutrino
       sodium22 -> neon22 + positron + neutrino

electron capture:
       Berillium8 + electron -> lithium + neutrino
       sodium22 + electron -> neon22 + neutrino

//
Nuclear weak interaction vs the weak interaction
The modern theory of the weak interaction is a quantum field theory that combines electronmagnetic interactions with a whole range of weak interactions.

The quanta of the fields include in addition to the photon (a massless boson) three very massive bosons with nuclear energies of approximately 90 giga electron volts: W-, W+ (both charged) and Z0 (uncharged)

The forces or interactions are explained in terms of exchanges of these force field bosons.

//
The phton has a zero rest mass and therefore the associated force is long range (approximately 1/r ~ V(r))

But the W-, W+ and Z0 bosons have a large mass and hence the associated forces are very short range

//
Neutron -> change proton -> out W- boson -> change out electron and neutrino

\  p+	   	/ e-
 \	       /
  >----->-----<			(Fenyman diagram)
 /	 W-    \
/  n		\ V_e

A neutron emits a W- boson and changes into a charged proton, in a very short interval the W- particle transforms into an electron and neutrino

Actually at a more basic level, the n and p are composed of 3 quarks - u(up) and d (down) quarks
Neutron = (udd)
Proton = (uud)

The u quark has a charge of +2/3 and d has a charged - 1/3
So the underlying process for n -> p + e- + neutrino
d->u+e+ve
(-1/3) -> (+2/3) -1 + 0

//
Hence a more fundamental level feynman diagram for beta decay is:


\  u	   	/ e-
 \	       /
  >----->-----<			(Fenyman diagram)
 /	 W-    \
/  d		\ V_e

However in the nuclear physics energy domain it suffices to think simply in terms of the point transitions
(1) n -> p + e- + neutrino
(2) p -> n + e+ + neutrino
(3) e+ + p -> n + neutrino
(all connected by the crossing principle due to the effect of weak interaction)

//
Nuclear strong force vs the strong force
The more fundamental theory that explains the finite structure of protons and neutrons is called quantum chromodynamics QCD and is a relativistic field theory. QCD describes the interactions between quarks in terms of an exchange of gluons.

//
The proton consists of three quarks (uud)
The neutron consists of 3 quarks (udd)

these quarks have fractional charges
u=+2/3e
d=-1/3e

The strong force is the force between quarks mediated by the exchange of gluons

//
Hence the nuclear strong force between nucleons is the net force between collections of quarks

//
This is analogous to the net residual electrostatic force that binds two neutral H atoms together to form the H_2 molecule

//
There are other quarks that appear at very high energies (particle physics) but are not relevant for nuclear physics energies.

In nuclear physics we describe the net attractive force between nucleons via a potential function based on empirical evidence.
