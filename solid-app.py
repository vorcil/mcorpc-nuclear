Purpose: Provide a banal framework to explore the exotic properties of solids,
to delve into the microscopic properties of mostly crystalline solids in raybanal crossectional analysis
"""

#Crystalline solids are materials with an atomic structure based on a repeated pattern (i.e. a regular and dense assembly of atoms very close together) something easily exploited with computational methods in computer science

#opposing to the particle physics modules included within the mcorpc repository, i.e. unfocusing on computational analysis of singularities and focus on general summation of "blocks" or "collections" of particles, can average quantities and utilize smaller sized variables (in terms of memory e.g not 10^-30 ~ 100-500)
