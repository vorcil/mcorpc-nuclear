Purpose: Provide a banal framework to explore the exotic properties of solids,
to delve into the microscopic properties of mostly crystalline solids in raybanal crossectional analysis

#Crystalline solids are materials with an atomic structure based on a repeated pattern (i.e. a regular and dense assembly of atoms very close together) something easily exploited with computational methods in computer science

#opposing to the particle physics modules included within the mcorpc repository, i.e. unfocusing on computational analysis of singularities and focus on general summation of "blocks" or "collections" of particles, can average quantities and utilize smaller sized variables (in terms of memory e.g not 10^-30 ~ 100-500)

    #user interface message
    technological_motivation="Solid State Physics is right at the heart of the majority of modern society and technology. The entire computer and electronics industry relies on the semiconductor. Solid State Physics is traditionally linked to materials science, chemistry & engineering but also recently overlaps with ibology, biochemistry, biotechnology & medicine."

    fundamental_motivation="The original motivation to study Solid State Physics is that the fundamental physics needed ot understand the microscopic properties of solids is very stimulating. To understand these properties, the ideas and methods of quantum mechanics had to be developed. The physics of solids is very deeply quantum mechanical."
